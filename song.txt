Post Malone - Take What You Want

oh
(Yeah)
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
I never needed anything from you
And all I ever asked was for the truth (all I ever asked was for)
You showed your tongue and it was forked in two
Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you (almost believed you)
Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake
Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown
Like a plague, I was wasting away
Tryna find my way out, find my way out (find my way out)
And it finally came the day
I start giving my heart away
For Heaven sakes, my bones will break
But you never own my soul, no
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
